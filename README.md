# Autonomous-Nursing-Robot
The project entails the development of an autonomous healthcare robot designed to revolutionize patient care in hospitals. This robot leverages advanced technologies, including Robotics Operating System (ROS), Lidar, and SLAM algorithms, to autonomously navigate medical facilities, monitor vital signs, dispense medication, and enable remote interaction between healthcare providers and patients. The robot's features include real-time patient parameter monitoring, precise localization, non-contact temperature assessment, and UV floor sanitization. The project aims to enhance the efficiency of healthcare processes, improve patient care, and promote the use of cutting-edge robotics in healthcare, ultimately benefiting both patients and healthcare providers.
