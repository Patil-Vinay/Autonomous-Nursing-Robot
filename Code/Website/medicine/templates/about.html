        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>In today's fast-paced world, healthcare professionals face numerous challenges, including high patient volumes, limited time, geographical barrier and medication errors. However, Imagine a world where distance and limited access to healthcare no longer hinder the delivery of essential medical services. Picture a scenario where doctors can seamlessly connect with patients in remote areas, providing timely diagnoses, expert advice, and personalized care without the constraints of physical proximity.</p>
        <p>Introducing Scobo, an advanced and revolutionary robot designed to transform healthcare and doctor-patient experience. Scobo serves as a game-changing solution that addresses the limitations of traditional healthcare delivery. With its advanced capabilities, Scobo enables doctors to conduct live, interactive consultations with patients from any part of the world. Through a web-based interface, doctors can remotely assess symptoms, discuss treatment plans, and provide medical expertise in real-time. Moreover, Scobo boasts a sophisticated pill dispensing system that optimizes medication management. Through seamless integration with an online interface, doctors can remotely prescribe medications and trigger Scobo to dispense them accurately. This eliminates the risk of errors and enhances medication adherence, promoting better patient outcomes and improving overall healthcare efficiency. With its seamless connectivity, advanced medication dispensing, and the potential for autonomous interaction, Scobo exemplifies the future of healthcare.</p>
        <p>Looking towards the future, Scobo aims to evolve into an autonomous and interactive companion for patients.

        <h3>Working</h3>
        <p>At the heart of its operation is a Django backend, serving as the backbone for connecting Scobo to the internet and enabling smooth communication between the robot and its web-based interface.</p>
        <p>The user interface is a dynamic website hosted online, accessible to doctors from any device with an internet connection. Through this intuitive interface, doctors can effortlessly interact with Scobo, remotely managing patient consultations and medication dispensing. By selecting the desired medicine and dosage on the website, doctors initiate actions that prompt Scobo to take appropriate measures.</p>
        <p>To execute the physical actions triggered by the website, Scobo relies on a NodeMCU, a powerful microcontroller embedded within the robot. This compact yet capable device acts as the intermediary, receiving instructions from the website and transmitting them to the mechanical components of Scobo.</p>
        <p>The mechanical aspect of Scobo is intricately designed to accommodate its pill dispensing system. As the NodeMCU receives the medication details from the website, it activates servo motors integrated into Scobo's structure. These servo motors, operating under the precise instructions of the NodeMCU, engage the necessary mechanisms to open the passage for the pill to be dispensed.</p>
        <p>With this synchronized collaboration between the Django backend, the web-based interface, the NodeMCU, and the mechanical components, Scobo ensures accurate and controlled pill dispensing. This technology-driven process guarantees that the prescribed medications are administered to patients with precision, eliminating the possibility of errors and enhancing medication adherence.</p>
